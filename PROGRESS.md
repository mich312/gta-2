# PROGRESS

## Phase 0 — workspace, sim skeleton, transport, bots, overlay, replay

**What changed.** Built the entire phase-0 skeleton from an empty repo: pnpm
workspace (`shared`/`server`/`client`), the deterministic sim core in
`shared/` (fixed 30 Hz `step()`, seeded mulberry32 PRNG stored in GameState,
sorted-id entity tables, deterministic polynomial sin/cos/atan2 so no engine
transcendentals ever touch the sim), the full wire protocol behind the
`Codec` interface (JSON now), delta snapshots against per-client acked ticks
with a 3 s ring and full-resync fallback, periodic FNV state hashes in
snapshots as the desync tripwire, the authoritative server (drift-corrected
tick loop, join/resume with per-session tokens, input sanitation at the trust
boundary), record/replay (every session records; the replay runner re-sims
and hash-verifies), the bot harness, and a minimal browser client (fixed
480×270 integer-scaled canvas, keyboard/mouse intents, `~` overlay with tick
rate, RTT, entities, KB/s, hitboxes, and the predicted-vs-authoritative ghost
slot). Sim tunables live in `shared/data/player.json`, loaded by each host
and injected via `initTuning()`. The `WEAPONS_LOST_ON_DEATH` env flag is
parsed in server config, ready for phase 4/5.

**Verification.** `pnpm test`: 27 tests green across shared+server, including
step determinism (same seed+inputs ⇒ identical hash), delta round-trip
equality, trust-boundary rejection tests, and a pinned PRNG known-answer
sequence. `pnpm bots --count=8 --script=cruise --duration=60`: all 8 bots
finished at the identical tick (1808..1808), 8 entities each, 0 desyncs,
0 stale deltas, 0 full resyncs; a 20 s `jitter` chaos run also passed. The
recorded replay of the live 8-bot session re-simulated twice to the same
final hash (`8fbba894`). Client typechecks and `vite build` passes.

**Deliberately deferred.** Prediction/reconciliation and interpolation
(phase 1) — the client renders raw snapshots, so remote motion quantizes to
snapshot arrival for now and the overlay ghost is trivially zero. The server
applies the newest queued intent per tick (input hold); phase 1 changes
consumption to one-intent-per-tick by seq for reconciliation. Snapshot
deltas diff whole fields (a moving player resends pos+vel every tick) — fine
under JSON, revisit with the binary codec or interest management. Deviations
from the PLAN file list: added `shared/src/net/sync.ts` (snapshot reassembly
shared by client and bots), `shared/src/net/hash.ts`, `shared/src/tuning.ts`,
and `server/src/tuning.ts` (fs loader); per-phase entity tables
(vehicles/peds/props) will be added to GameState in their phases rather than
sitting empty now.

**Least confident about.** (1) Wall-clock input timing: bots and client send
intents on their own setInterval/rAF clocks and the server applies "latest
wins" — good enough for lockstep verification, but phase 1's
tick-aligned input scheduling is where real timing bugs will surface, and
the current smoothness is not evidence they don't exist. (2) The resume path
is tested at the session level but not end-to-end under a real mid-game
socket drop with a stale ack ring. (3) Bandwidth (~29 KB/s per client with 8
players under JSON) is fine now but the JSON+full-field-diff combination has
no headroom for phase 7's pedestrians — the interest-management milestone is
carrying real load.
